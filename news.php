			<p>When it comes to extreme situations, water is the most important element for survival. Your body loses on average 2.5 liters (or 2/3 of a gallon) of water everyday, but can handle only a loss of about 10-22% (which happens after about 3 days of no water) of its water weight before it becomes fatal. Secure your family's health by obtaining a fresh water supply now to prepare for emergencies like earthquakes, violent storms, or contaminated public water supplies with this high-capacity water tank.</p>
